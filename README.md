# Infection & Immunity Geeks!

Hi there! This is the public repository for open source code generated by the geeks over at Cardiff University School of Medicine Division of Infection and Immunity.

Here you will find tools, tutorials, and open source code snippets related to the research performed in our department.

## Enviroments

In the enviroments folder you will find YAML files corresponding to programming enviroments that have been generated for code within this repository. This makes it easy to replicate the work here on your own device. When you create a new enviroment from one of our YAML files, all the necessary programming libraries to replicate our work will automatically be installed. 

The easiest way to get started with these enviroments is with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). If you don't have Anaconda, head over to their site and check it out. Anaconda makes it easy to [manage enviroments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). 

To install an enviroment from a YAML file, you simply run the following in command line:

`conda env create -f enviroment_name.yml`
